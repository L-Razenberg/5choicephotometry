%readme and how-to for preprocessing scripts



ABFFIO.dll and Abf2Tmp.exe
These are files you need to convert a .abf file to .txt. We need this because our output is .abf format,
which can't be read by matlab or any other text manager, so it needs to be converted. These executive
files need to be in the same directory as the .abf files.

abf2load
This is the script you run to convert .abf to .txt. It needs the two files above in the same dir. 

txtMat
This is a small script to convert .txt to .mat, which runs a lot faster in matlab. It is now set to 
convert all .txt files in a dir, but you can take parts of the function to convert a single file.
